WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <UART_RXD_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the
   design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization
   data, both user defined and default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information, please reference

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   731 out of   2,278   32%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,143
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           709 out of   2,143   33%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             101 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
